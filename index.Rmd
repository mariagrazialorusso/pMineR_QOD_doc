# Class Introduction

The Qod class provides methods for performing preliminary analyses on the data.

```{r,echo=TRUE,eval=TRUE,results='hide', warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
library(pMineR)

objDL<-dataLoader()
objDL$load.csv(nomeFile = "EventLog1.csv",IDName = "ID",EVENTName = "Event",dateColumnName = "Date",format.column.date = "%Y-%m-%d")
obj.out<-objDL$getData()

objQOD<-QOD()
objQOD$loadDataset(dataList = obj.out)

```
# Co-occurrence Analysis: eventHeatmap()

The **eventHeatmap()** function allows to display a heatmap showing the co-occurrence of events: 

```{r}
objQOD$eventHeatmap(threshold.low = 0,threshold.hi = 1)
```

Each cell _ci,j_ of the matrix, indicates the number of times the event in _row-i_ and _column-j_ appear in the same trace out of the total number of times the event in row-i occurs. 



# Path matching: query() function

The **query()** functions allows to extract a certain sub-portion of the event Log, corresponding to cases whose trace meets specific requirements specified in the function input. These requirements refer to certain features that the trace must reflect:

 - _from_ : The starting event;
 - _to_ : The ending event;
 - _time.range and UM_: The time between the two events and its unit of time measurement (whether in hours, days,
weeks, months, or years);
 - _arr.passingThrough_ : events should have occurred between the 'from' event and the 'to' event
 - _arr.NOTpassingThrough_ : events should not have occurred between the 'from' event and the 'to' event
 - _step.range_: the min and max number of events should have occurred between the 'from' event and the 'to' event


the query() function allows for two different types of output, according to the value of the _returnCompleteMatrix_. If it is setted to TRUE, the function returns a matrix containing the following informations:

 - ID (first column) : the casse-ID whose trace matches the specified requirements;
 - The "from" and "to" columns explicit the cardinality that the start and end of the pattern hold within the trace.
 - The "step" column indicates the number of events that lie between 'from' and 'to' event.
 - The "time" column indicates the duration between 'from' and 'to' event


```{r,echo=TRUE,eval=TRUE}

objQOD$query(from = "Biopsy",
             to = "death",
             time.range = c(0,20),
             UM = "days",
             returnCompleteMatrix = T)


```

If you want the function to return only an array with case IDs, the  _returnCompleteMatrix_ input must be setted to FALSE.


```{r,echo=TRUE,eval=TRUE}

array.ID<-objQOD$query(from = "Biopsy",
             to = "death",
             time.range = c(0,20),
             UM = "days",
             returnCompleteMatrix = F)
print(array.ID)

```


# Timeline visualization: plotTimeline() function 

It is possible to visualize the temporal evolution of their traces through the visualization of a timeline. 


```{r}
arr.ID<-objQOD$plotTimeline(objDL.obj = obj.out, max.time = 20,UM = "weeks")

```
It is possible to filter the number of trace to plot by passing the function an array containing the IDs of the cases you want to investigate. 

```{r}
objQOD$plotTimeline(objDL.obj = obj.out, max.time = 20,UM = "weeks",arr.ID = array.ID)
```
